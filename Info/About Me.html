        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I was Born in Israel. When i turned 1 years old my parents took me to the USA. 
            I lived in the states for most of my life. I had a pretty nice life there, I met good people.
             When i turned 13 my parents got divorced. I ended up living with my mom and we moved to Arizona.</p>
        <p>In Arizona I went to junior high school.
             After a year there my mom sent me back to my dad. Me and my dad moved to Israel trying to make things good.
              After 2 years I moved back to the states. In the states I worked in the diamond bussiness.
        </p>
        <p>2 Years later i moved back to Israel alone to make my own life. At 18 i joined the army in "Black Cats unit".
             I spent around 3 in a half years in the army finding my place. 
             I ended up finding my wife there and still looking for myself. After leaving the army life was hard.</p>
        <p>I worked in so many jobs a driver, warehouse sorter and even in HVAC. 
            Now im studying FullStack Web Dev and I think I finaly found my calling.</p>
